# DSA Solutions: Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet
## 👋 About This Repo
Welcome! This repository is my personal logbook and collection of solutions for the problems featured in the highly-regarded **Striver's A2Z DSA Sheet.**

### From General Practice to a Focused Goal
This repository started as a general collection of my solutions to various problems from platforms like LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks. I am currently in the process of **restructuring and refocusing** this entire repository to exclusively follow and solve the A2Z DSA Sheet, topic by topic.

This is a **work in progress.** You will notice that the current folder structure is a mix of the old and the new. My goal is to have a clean, well-organized collection of solutions that aligns perfectly with the A2Z sheet's structure.

## 🗺️ Roadmap & Restructuring Plan
My immediate goal is to reorganize the existing solutions and add new ones to match the official A2Z sheet's format. The current structure is a work-in-progress.

The **target structure** I am working towards is as follows:
```
.
├── Learn the basics
│   ├── Things to Know in C++ or Java or Python or any language
│   ├── Build-up Logical Thinking
│   └── Know Basic Maths
├── Learn Important Sorting Techniques
│   ├── Sorting-I
│   └── Sorting-II
├── Solve Problems on Arrays [Easy, Medium, Hard]
│   ├── Easy
│   ├── Medium
│   └── Hard
├── Binary Search [1D, 2D Arrays, Search Space]
│   ├── ...
...
└── Graphs [Concepts & Problems]
    ├── ...

```

This will make it much easier to navigate and track progress against the sheet.

## 🤝 How to Contribute
Since this is an active refactoring repo, contributions are highly welcome and appreciated! You can help in several ways:

- **Adding New Solutions:** If you see a problem from the sheet that's missing, feel free to add a solution.
- **Restructuring:** Help move existing solution files from the old folders into the new, structured directories.
- **Improving Solutions:** Suggest optimizations or add comments to existing solutions.
- **Adding Other Languages:** While all solutions are in C++, adding versions in **Java** or **Python** would be a fantastic contribution.

### Contribution Steps:
1. **Fork** the Project.
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourContribution`).
3. **Commit** your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some YourContribution'`).
4. **Push** to the Branch  (`git push origin feature/YourContribution`).
5. Open a **Pull Request.**
